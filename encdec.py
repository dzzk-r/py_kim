    # ToDo:
    # - Clarify 1st step questions:
    #   - Should vowels be marked? (e.g., "#101")
    #   - Should consonants shift 1 or 2 letters?
    #   - Preserve case in 'z' to 'a' scenario?

    return with_hash


    # STEP 5 - Number Encoding
    # For each numeric sequence:
    # - Multiply the number by 3
    # - Reverse the resulting digits
    # - Optionally, insert "#" between digits (depending on final format spec)

    # ToDo:
    # - Confirm target format: "3#69" vs "9#6#3"
    # - Are numbers grouped or handled digit-by-digit?
